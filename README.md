# Welcome to Deadwood!
This is a command-line program based off the board game Deadwood. 

TO-DO:
-

## Setting up the board:
- ***Four rearrangeable board sections***
- Each player has a rank. Use name for identification, or playerNum. Depends on XML!
- Each player starts with ***rank of 1*** in the Trailers. (setRoom(SubRoomClass))
- Shuffle deck and deal one card to each set on the board, face down. Each card is a scene.
- ***Ten*** sets on the board, ***40*** scene cards.
- Depending on where each scene is shooting, it might require ***1, 2, or 3*** shots to finish. On each set, place a "shot marker"
on each of the numbered circles. You will remove these markers as you complete shots.


## Setup for Different Group Sizes:
- If there are ***2 or 3 players***, play only ***3 days***
- If there are ***4 players***, there are no changes
- If there are ***5 players***, start each player with ***2 credits***
- If there are ***6 players***, start each player with ***4 credits***
- If there are ***7 or 8 players***, rather than the credits listed above, ***start everyone with a rank of 2.***

Your Goal
---
- Game lasts four days
- Score the most points at the end
- Score will be a combination of your money, your credits, and five times your rank.

Perform A Turn
---
On your turn, you can do the following:
- **Move:** if you are not working on a role, you can move one step and/or take a role. Both of these actions are optional.
- **Work:** if you are working on a role, you must either act (roll a die) or rehearse (take a rehearsal chip),
You must either act or rehearse, because you can't walk off a role once you are on it.
- **Upgrade:** CAN ONLY BE IN CASTING OFFICE, you can pay to raise your rank. You may do this before or after your move
